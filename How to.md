## History of Seal carving：
Seal carving is a traditional art form, named after the seal script used in ancient times. [1] It is an art form that combines calligraphy and engraving (including chiseling and casting) to make seals. In terms of production technology, it refers to the process of engraving a designed pattern or text on a flat surface onto metal, stone, ivory, horn and other materials.
Chinese seals have different names over time and according to different users. Before the Qin Dynasty, seals were called 鉨 (same as 玺). After Qin Shihuang unified China, he stipulated that the emperor should use 玺, and ordinary people's seals were called 印. In the Han Dynasty, the seals used by the emperor, empress, and kings were called 玺. Official and private seals were also called 章, 印章 and 印信. In the Tang Dynasty, they were called 宝. Since the Song and Yuan Dynasties, official and private seals have been called 记, 朱记, 关防, 押, 图章, 抽子 and other names. Seal carving originated in China and later spread and became popular in East Asia.
