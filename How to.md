# Seal Stone Carving
This workshop is designed for beginners and aims to guide students through the basics of traditional Chinese seal carving (篆刻). Students will learn about the history, tools, and techniques and then put their new skills into practice by creating a personal seal.

## History of Seal carving：
Seal carving is a traditional art form, named after the seal script used in ancient times. It is an art form that combines calligraphy and engraving (including chiseling and casting) to make seals. In terms of production technology, it refers to the process of engraving a designed pattern or text on a flat surface onto metal, stone, ivory, horn and other materials.
Chinese seals have different names over time and according to different users. Before the Qin Dynasty, seals were called 鉨 (same as 玺). After Qin Shihuang unified China, he stipulated that the emperor should use 玺, and ordinary people's seals were called 印. In the Han Dynasty, the seals used by the emperor, empress, and kings were called 玺. Official and private seals were also called 章, 印章 and 印信. In the Tang Dynasty, they were called 宝. Since the Song and Yuan Dynasties, official and private seals have been called 记, 朱记, 关防, 押, 图章, 抽子 and other names. Seal carving originated in China and later spread and became popular in East Asia.

## Step 1 - Sand Stone
去除部分石头上的蜡 / 将石头打磨平整 确保每个地方都能与纸张充分接触

材料：水砂纸 原石

Outcome（配图） - 石头表面光滑平整并且不再有蜡

## Step 2 - Design Character/Shape
在石头表面画上**相反**的图案，确定笔触，位置，为雕刻做准备

材料：trace paper pen mirror（optional）

Tips：考虑整体构图的稳定性，考虑为图案加上边框，边框通常为上窄下宽，使得整个图案变得稳定

Outcome(配图) - 在石头表面画上相反的图案，确保笔触和最终成品一样

沿着

材料： 刻刀 原石 印台（optional）毛刷（optional）

Tips：
篆刻分为阳文和阴文，又称之为朱/白文，这和最后呈现的效果相关，通常来说阳文比较容易展示较好效果
阳/朱文是保留文字部分，字体/图案呈现为红色
阴/白文是保留字体外的部分，字体/图案呈现为白色

篆刻姿势：

材料：印泥 / Seal stone

tips：确保每一个笔触都有在最后的成品中显现，如果笔触有缺失，说明印面高低不平
高的地方可以重新打磨雕刻
低的地方（通常由于石头在雕刻中碎裂）可以将高的地方打磨至最低处，然后重新刻划一部分细节。

# Stone Carving Process

---

## Step 1 – Sand the Stone

**Description:**  
Remove the wax on parts of the stone and sand it flat so that every area can fully contact the paper.

**Materials:**  
- Wet/dry sandpaper  
- Raw stone

**Outcome:**  
The stone’s surface is smooth, even, and free of wax.

**Process:**  
1. **Wet the Sandpaper:**  
   Wet the sandpaper and keep it moist during sanding.

2. **Sand in Parallel:**  
   Sand the stone surface with parallel strokes.

## Step 2 – Design Character/Shape

**Description:**  
Draw the **reversed** pattern on the stone surface to define the brush strokes and positions, preparing for carving.

**Materials:**  
- Trace paper  
- Pen  
- Mirror (optional)

**Tips:**  
Consider the overall stability of the composition. Adding a border (narrower at the top and wider at the bottom) can help stabilize the design.

**Outcome:**  
A reversed pattern is drawn on the stone surface, ensuring that the brush strokes match the final product.

## Step 3 – Enjoy Carving

**Description:**  
Carve along the drawn pattern.

**Materials:**  
- Carving knife  
- Raw stone  
- Ink pad (optional)  
- Brush (optional)

**Tips:**  
- Seal carving is divided into positive (yang) and negative (yin) methods, also known as Zhu (red) and White inscriptions.  
- In positive (red) carving, the preserved part appears in red.  
- In negative (white) carving, the area around the characters or design is preserved to appear white.

**Carving Posture:**

## Step 4 – Dip and Seal

**Materials:**  
- Ink pad / Seal stone

**Tips:**  
Ensure every brush stroke appears in the final product. If a stroke is missing, it indicates that the seal surface is uneven.  
- Re-sand and re-carve high areas.  
- For low areas (often caused by stone fracture during carving), sand the high areas down to the lowest level and re-carve some details.
