## History of Seal carving：
Seal carving is a traditional art form, named after the seal script used in ancient times. It is an art form that combines calligraphy and engraving (including chiseling and casting) to make seals. In terms of production technology, it refers to the process of engraving a designed pattern or text on a flat surface onto metal, stone, ivory, horn and other materials.
Chinese seals have different names over time and according to different users. Before the Qin Dynasty, seals were called 鉨 (same as 玺). After Qin Shihuang unified China, he stipulated that the emperor should use 玺, and ordinary people's seals were called 印. In the Han Dynasty, the seals used by the emperor, empress, and kings were called 玺. Official and private seals were also called 章, 印章 and 印信. In the Tang Dynasty, they were called 宝. Since the Song and Yuan Dynasties, official and private seals have been called 记, 朱记, 关防, 押, 图章, 抽子 and other names. Seal carving originated in China and later spread and became popular in East Asia.

## Step 1 – Sand the Stone
Remove the wax on parts of the stone and sand it flat so that every area can fully contact the paper.

**Materials:**  
- Wet/dry sandpaper  
- Raw stone

**Outcome:**  
The stone’s surface is smooth, even, and free of wax.

**Process:**  
Wet the sandpaper and keep it moist during sanding.

Sand the stone surface with parallel strokes.

## Step 2 – Design Character/Shape
Draw the **reversed** pattern on the stone surface to define the brush strokes and positions, preparing for carving.

**Materials:**  
- Trace paper  
- Pen  
- Mirror (optional)

**Tips:**  
Consider the overall stability of the composition. Adding a border (narrower at the top and wider at the bottom) can help stabilize the design.

**Outcome:**  
A reversed pattern is drawn on the stone surface, ensuring that the brush strokes match the final product.

## Step 3 – Enjoy Carving
Carve alone the Pattern and Practice

**Materials:**  
- Carving knife  
- Raw stone  
- Ink pad (optional)  
- Brush (optional)

**Tips:**  
- Seal carving is divided into Yáng(positive) and Yīn(negative), also known as Zhū (red) and Bái (White).  
- For Yang / Zhu carving, preserved the area around the characters or design and character appears in red.  
- In Yin / Bai carving, Carve the characters or design and character appears in red.

**Possible Carving Postures:**

## Step 4 – Dip and Seal

**Materials:**  
- Ink pad / Seal stone

**Tips:**  
Ensure every brush stroke appears in the final product. If a stroke is missing, it indicates that the seal surface is uneven.  
- For high areas Re-sand and re-carve.  
- For low areas (often caused by stone fracture during carving), sand the high areas down to the lowest level and re-carve some details.

**Outcome:**
