## History of Seal Carving

Seal carving is a traditional art form named after the seal script used in ancient times. It combines calligraphy and engraving (including chiseling and casting) to create seals. In production, a designed pattern or text is engraved onto a flat surface of metal, stone, ivory, horn, or other materials.

Chinese seals have been known by different names throughout history and vary with usage.  
- **Before the Qin Dynasty:** Seals were called 鉨 (the same as 玺).  
- **After Qin Shihuang unified China:** The emperor used 玺, and ordinary people’s seals were called 印.  
- **Han Dynasty:** Seals for the emperor, empress, and kings were called 玺; official and private seals were also known as 章, 印章, and 印信.  
- **Tang Dynasty:** They were called 宝.  
- **Since the Song and Yuan Dynasties:** Official and private seals have been referred to as 记, 朱记, 关防, 押, 图章, 抽子, and other names.

Seal carving originated in China and later spread to become popular throughout East Asia.

## Step 1 – Sand the Stone

**Objective:**  
Remove the wax on parts of the stone and sand it flat so that every area can fully contact the paper.

**Materials:**  
- Wet/dry sandpaper  
- Raw stone

**Outcome:**  
The stone’s surface is smooth, even, and free of wax.

**Process:**  
1. **Wet the Sandpaper:**  
   Keep the sandpaper moist during sanding.

2. **Sand with Parallel Strokes:**  
   Sand the stone surface evenly using parallel strokes.

## Step 2 – Design Character/Shape

**Objective:**  
Draw the **reversed** pattern on the stone surface to define the brush strokes and positions, preparing for carving.

**Materials:**  
- Trace paper  
- Pen  
- Mirror (optional)

**Tips:**  
Consider the overall stability of the composition. Adding a border (narrower at the top and wider at the bottom) can help stabilize the design.

**Outcome:**  
A reversed pattern is drawn on the stone surface, ensuring that the brush strokes match the final product.

## Step 3 – Enjoy Carving

**Objective:**  
Carve along the pattern and practice your technique.

**Materials:**  
- Carving knife  
- Raw stone  
- Ink pad (optional)  
- Brush (optional)

**Tips:**  
- Seal carving is divided into Yáng (positive) and Yīn (negative) methods, also known as Zhū (red) and Bái (white).  
- For Yang/Zhū carving, preserve the area around the characters/design so that they appear in red.  
- For Yin/Bái carving, carve the characters/design to create a red appearance.

## Step 4 – Dip and Seal

**Objective:**  
Ensure every brush stroke appears in the final product. Missing strokes indicate an uneven seal surface.

**Materials:**  
- Ink pad / Seal stone

**Tips:**  
- For high areas, re-sand and re-carve.  
- For low areas (often due to stone fracture during carving), sand the high areas down to the lowest level and re-carve some details.

**Outcome:**

**Process:**  
- Stir the ink with a stick in one direction (optional).  
- *PlaceHolder for additional instructions.*
